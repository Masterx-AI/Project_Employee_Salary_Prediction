### Description:

The data consists of Salaries of Employees, including their gender, age & phD degree. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Properties of the Dataset:** \
Number of Instances: 100\
Number of Attributes: 4 including the class attribute

The dataset is simple yet challenging as it is has very limited features & samples. Can you build regression model to catpture all the patterns in the dataset, also maitaining the generalisability of the model?


### Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & perform the necessary cleanup.
- Build Regression models & fine-tune the hyperparamters to predict the emplyee salaries.
- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

### Strategis Plan of Action:
We aim to solve the current problem statement by creating plan of action, Here are some of the necessary steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Feature Selection/Extraction
5. Predictive Modelling
6. Project Outcomes & Conclusion

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
- The Dataset was quiet small totally just 100 samples & after preprocessing 1% of the datasamples were dropped. 
- Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the feature-set.
- The features had some multicollinearity, but since we had only 4 features, we did not perform any feature selection/extraction.
- Testing multiple algorithms with hyperparamter-tuning gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
- While, Polynomial Regression (Order-2) gave the best overall scores for the current dataset, yet it wise to also consider simpler models like MLR & ENR as they are more generalisable.
